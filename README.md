# Gym tracker
At any time, sport is the most important thing for maintaining health. But not everyone is able to independently choose a training plan and the ability to constantly do it. In turn, I offer an application that is able to solve these and other problems. **Gym Tracker** is a convenient application for doing sports for all muscle groups. This application provides an opportunity for the user to create an individual training plan for himself, which will help him to go to his goal and achieve results 💪⚡️. You can add the workouts you like to your favorites and on the main menu you can see the recommended workouts. Additionally, there are also news and articles on sports and nutrition. You can download on your android mobile phone and run this application from the "Releases" section of Github 📱🚀.
